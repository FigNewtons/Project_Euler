#Project Euler Challenge 21

'''
Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n
(numbers less than n which divide evenly into n).
If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b, then a and b
are an amicable pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.
Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.
